Hi! My name is Kevin and I am a Bachelor of Commerce (Economics and Business Analytics) and Information Systems student at UNSW

Throughout my career I have developed a strong passion for technology. I am passionate about the processes and architecture in place that allows technology to provide tangible value for people and organisations.
